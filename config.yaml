    title: Made with love
    description: I'm fascinated by everything related to the sea. The beauty
                 of shades and shapes of shells and stones and the amazing
                 creatures living in the ocean. Listening to the waves crashing
                 at shore gives me a deep sense of peace and relaxation.

    about: About Me
    description: I am an artist based in Tel Aviv, Israel. I received my education
                 at Arts Academy of St. Petersburg, Russia. In the beginning of my
                 career I worked as a stage designer but now I dedicate all my time
                 to painting. I enjoy my working time, it's the best time for me.
