    title: Made with love
    description: "What I try to express through my painting is a sense of harmony
                 in the nature, the magic that is hidden even in the smallest things.
                 I agree with Andrew Wyeth when he says: <cite>&ldquo;One's art goes
                 as far and as deep as one's love goes&rdquo;</cite>."

    about: About Me
    description: I am an artist based in Tel Aviv, Israel. I received my education
                 at Arts Academy of St. Petersburg, Russia. In the beginning of my
                 career I worked as a stage designer but now I dedicate all my time
                 to painting. I enjoy my working time, it's the best time for me.
